## General info

A game for kids who want to learn to count money. Select the difficulty of  level  and put money  into the pig's belly. If the number of coins in the pig matches the amount, the next amount will renders. If it doesn't, an error message will shows. After 15 seconds, the light bulb appears, so you can use the hints.
